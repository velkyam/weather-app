# weather-app
The goal of this project was to create a weather web application. The website was build to provide current weather and near future weather forecast at any user input city. The app provides icon, temperature, wind, and humidity for today and 5 other days. Furthermore, it stores user input cities in local storage to make cities quickly accessible even if the site closes.
